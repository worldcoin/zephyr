	  Enable driver for VL53L1X I2C-based time of flight sensor.

	bool "Use interrupt mode for VL53L1X time of flight sensor"
	default y
	depends on GPIO
	help
	  Enable interrupt mode for VL53L1X time of flight sensor. Otherwise,
	  the driver will use the polling method.

config VL53L1X_XSHUT
	bool "Use xshut pin on VL53L1X time of flight sensor"
	depends on GPIO
	help
	  Enable to use the xshut pin on the VL53L1X. If not, the pin should be
	  connected to VDD.

config VL53L1X_PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD
    int "Proximity threshold in millimeters"
    default 100
    help
        Distance in millimeters by which an object is detected in close proximity.
        When sensor is used with SENSOR_CHAN_PROX.

config VL53L1X_SIGNAL_SPAD_RATIO_THRESHOLD
	int "Signal SPAD ratio threshold"
	default 300
	help
	  The signal to SPAD-count ratio is used for proximity detection when sensor is used with SENSOR_CHAN_PROX.
	  It helps remove false positives when the sensor is used in a dark environment and spits out phantom readings.
	  The ratio is calculated as follows:
	  	ratio = (Signal rate / SPAD count) * 1000

config VL53L1X_PROXIMITY_RANGE_MINIMUM
    int "Accepted distance range, minimum value (millimeters)"
    default 0
    help
        Minimum distance value that is accepted as valid proximity reading.
        Under this value, proximity reading is considered invalid.
        By default, accept all values.
